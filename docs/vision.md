# AI CRM – Vision

## Goal
Build a minimalist, operator-first CRM that feels like a daily cockpit:
- You open it and immediately know what to do today.
- Everything is centered on tasks + recent activity, not just records.

## What “good” feels like
- Fast: 1–2 clicks to log a touch or create a follow-up.
- Alive: stale deals, overdue tasks, and recent touches are visible.
- Safe: all changes are previewed and approved when coming from an assistant.
- Cheap: most actions are deterministic (no AI call); AI is used only when needed.

## Core entities
- Deals
- Accounts
- Leads
- Tasks (Today / Overdue / Upcoming)
- Activities (emails/calls/notes)

## AI assistant principle
Free-form conversation, but structured execution:
- Interpret naturally.
- Propose changes as structured actions.
- Validate + preview diff.
- User approves, then apply.
